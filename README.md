# I5Comunicator
I5Comunicator a software that allow to create, modify and compile code RPG,CLE from I5

I made this last project because, as you already know, i worked for a bank where we used i5 (as400) as our main server. The project is a source code manipulator: it can create, modify, erase and compile source code that is inside the i5 server. All the code was done in java using JT400 as a communication library. 
The program is Main.java.
